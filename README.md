Creating a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focusing on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file.

In the world of cybersecurity, understanding threats is crucial for defence. This code snippet is of keylogger - a program that captures keystrokes.

While they can have legitimate uses in controlled environments (like monitoring parental controls or educational software), keyloggers in the wrong hands can be devastating. They can steal passwords, credit card details, and other sensitive information. 

The working of code is as:
1. The program continuously listens for user input from the console and logs each keystroke along with a timestamp.
2. The program stops when the string "exit" is typed as an input. 
3. It automatically creates a log file and after that appends the subsequent keystrokes. 

This simple yet powerful tool serves as a foundational building block for understanding how malicious actors might attempt to capture sensitive information through unauthorised means.
